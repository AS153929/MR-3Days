[Verse 1]
镜子里那张脸 既熟悉又陌生 (The face in the mirror, familiar yet strange)
二十四岁的眼睛 藏着四十五岁的灵魂 (24-year-old eyes, hiding a 45-year-old soul)
手腕上没有劳力士 只有机油的灰尘 (No Rolex on the wrist, just machine oil dust)
但我听得见 时代的齿轮 在血管里翻滚 (But I can hear the gears of the era turning in my veins)

[Pre-Chorus]
点燃一支烟 烟雾遮住谎言 (Light a cigarette, smoke hides the lies)
系上红领带 就像系上誓言 (Tie the red tie, like tying a vow)
我不属于这里 但我必须留下 (I don't belong here, but I must stay)
为了那个背影 不再被命运压垮 (So that back won't be crushed by fate again)

[Chorus]
两个灵魂 在同一个身体里对弈 (Two souls, playing chess in one body)
一场豪赌 只有三天的时间呼吸 (A gamble, only three days to breathe)
我要用未来的眼光 换你现在的奇迹 (I'll trade future vision for your present miracle)
Fortune favors the bold, 这是最后的战役 (Fortune favors the bold, this is the final battle)

[Verse 2]
和平饭店的爵士乐 掩盖不住心跳 (Jazz at the Peace Hotel can't hide the heartbeat)
贪婪的汇率在诱惑 像深渊在冷笑 (Greedy exchange rates tempt like a cold abyss)
但我看见了十年后 谁在废墟上屹立 (But I see who stands on the ruins ten years later)
正直是唯一的筹码 我绝不会抛弃 (Integrity is the only chip I won't discard)

[Bridge]
(Guitar Solo - High energy, soaring)
爸，你看得见吗？(Dad, can you see?)
这不再是你的败局 (This is no longer your defeat)
这是我们的开局 (This is our opening game)

[Outro]
Zippo的火光 照亮了黄浦江 (Zippo's flame lights up the Huangpu River)
梦醒的时候 历史已更改了方向 (When the dream ends, history has changed course)
(Fade out with synth arpeggios)

[Verse 1]
Another hotel room, another city view
The air conditioning hums, a cold and lonely tune
I've got a Filofax full of names, but no one to call
Just a man in a suit, standing against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
They show me samples, they show me smiles
But I can see the tricks across the miles
Show me the numbers, don't waste my time
I'm looking for a partner, not just a dime

[Chorus]
Fortune favors the bold, that's what the lighter says
But fortune is a cold friend on these rainy days
I've won every deal, I've conquered every mart
But I lost the way to my own children's heart
Yeah, fortune favors the bold...

[Verse 2]
Then you walked in, with that cheap red tie
Looking at me with a fire in your eye
You said "No" to the money, you said "Yes" to the trust
You blew away the cynicism, you blew away the dust

[Bridge]
(Saxophone Solo - Melancholic and smoky)
Maybe I was wrong about this place
Maybe I see myself in your face
A young man fighting for a father's pride
Something I left on the other side

[Outro]
Keep the lighter, kid. You need the luck.
I'll take the memory.
(Piano fades out with rain sounds)

三千个家庭的饭碗 端在我手里 (Three thousand families' rice bowls in my hands)
这副担子太重 压弯了我的脊 (This burden is too heavy, bending my spine)

[Pre-Chorus]
时代变了 像黄浦江的水 (Times have changed, like the river's flow)
后浪推着前浪 我们该往哪走 (Waves pushing waves, where do we go?)
